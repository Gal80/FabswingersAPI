# FabswingersAPI
A facade over the current fabswingers website in the hope of inspiring a better UX

Intended as a bit of a toy project to learn some good software principles and some technologies I've been intending on getting round to for a while - cloud native, RxJava, Mockito, Java 8/9, Spring Boot.

Should be a RESTful interface for the www.fabswingers.com website split logically into features and producing JSON responses, facilitating development of a better UX/ UI should anyone want to pick up that mantle.
